## Trade-offs & Considerations

1. **Static Data**: Currently uses sample data. Production would integrate with backend API.

2. **Cell Editing**: Basic text editing implemented. Advanced formatting would require rich text editor.

3. **Filtering**: Filter tabs are UI-only. Full filtering logic would require data manipulation.

4. **Mobile Performance**: Optimized for mobile but large datasets would benefit from virtual scrolling.

5. **Touch Interactions**: Basic touch support. Advanced gestures could enhance mobile experience.

## Stretch Goals Implemented

- ✅ **Mobile Responsiveness**: Full responsive design with mobile-first approach
- ✅ **Keyboard Navigation**: Full arrow key navigation within the grid
- ✅ **Interactive Elements**: All buttons and tabs log actions to console
- ✅ **Type-Specific Rendering**: Status badges, priority colors, URL styling
- ✅ **Exact Visual Match**: Pixel-perfect recreation of the provided design
- ✅ **Touch Optimization**: Mobile-friendly interactions and layouts

## Future Enhancements
